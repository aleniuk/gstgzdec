BUILD
--------
1) Make sure you have available pkg-configs of
- gstreamer
- gstreamer-base
- gstreamer-controller
- zlib

2) Make sure you have libbz2 headers and shared library at the
same path's as zlib's headers and shared library

3) run autogen.sh and make

$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=PATH_TO_BUILD

$ make && make install

This will build plugin for gstreamer-0.10 .
To build plugin for gstreamer-1.0 , please specify an option:

$ ./autogen.sh --enable-version-1 --prefix=PATH_TO_BUILD

also:
--
If you're rebuilding from one version of gstreamer to another,
please first make some cleanups (on my system "make install" installs to old --prefix without it):

$ make clean
$ git clean -f
--

TESTING
-------
Plugin and wrapper for zlib/libbz2 have it's own separate automated tests.
They're running using shell scripts.

$ cat src/test-wrapper.sh | less
$ cat src/test-plugin.sh | less

To run first you need edit script: specify some directory with files, that it will use for tests:
- compress them
- decompress them with wrapper/plugin
- check the result file is the same as source file with "cmp"

And also for plugin test specify version of gstreamer, and
installed "--prefix"


EXAMPLE
--------
I do it like that:
$ git clone https://github.com/aleniuk/gstgzdec.git
$ cd gstgzdec
$ export MY_PREF=$HOME/GNOME
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$MY_PREF/lib

# the next two is if you have gstreamer, zlib and libbz2 installed to $MY_PREF
# (I build the debug versions of them):
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH/pkgconfig
$ export PATH=$PATH:$MY_PREF/bin

# ok, now let's configure and start the build
$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=$MY_PREF
$ make
$ make install
$ cd src

# modify test scripts for gstreamer version and path for data, that will be used in tests
# also maybe you don't have valgrind installed, then remove it from script.

(sorry, didn't have time for sed and the data path in configure.ac)
(I shoild make it create some garbage in special data path)

$ ./test-plugin.sh
