BUILD
--------
1) Make sure you have available pkg-configs of
- gstreamer
- gstreamer-base
- gstreamer-controller
- zlib

2) Make sure you have libbz2 headers and shared library at the
same path's as zlib's headers and shared library

3) run autogen.sh and make

$ ./autogen.sh --prefix=PATH_TO_BUILD

$ make && make install

This will build plugin for gstreamer-0.10 .
To build plugin for gstreamer-1.0 , please specify an option:

$ ./autogen.sh --enable-version-1 --prefix=PATH_TO_BUILD

also:
--
If you're rebuilding from one version of gstreamer to another,
please first make some cleanups (on my system "make install" installs to old --prefix without it):

$ make clean
$ git clean -f
--

TESTING
-------
Plugin and wrapper for zlib/libbz2 have it's own separate automated tests.
They're running using shell scripts.

$ cat src/test-wrapper.sh | less
$ cat src/test-plugin.sh | less

To run first you need edit script: specify some directory with files, that it will use for tests:
- compress them
- decompress them with wrapper/plugin
- check the result file is the same as source file with "cmp"

And also for plugin test specify version of gstreamer, and
installed "--prefix"
